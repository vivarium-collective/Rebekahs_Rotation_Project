This repository contains work from my rotation project on eco-evolutionary dynamics and using complete metabolic genome scale reconstructions of the human-gut microbiome.   

1. [In silico functions]([url](https://github.com/vivarium-collective/Rebekahs_Rotation_Project/tree/main/in_silico_functions))
Functions developed to aid in analysis of metabolic models.
2.  [In silico notebooks]([url](https://github.com/vivarium-collective/Rebekahs_Rotation_Project/tree/main/in_silico_notebooks))
Experiments investigating [COBRApy models]([url](https://cobrapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) and [cdFBA simulations]([url](https://github.com/vivarium-collective/Rebekahs_Rotation_Project/tree/main/in_silico_notebooks/cdFBA%20simulations)) of cross-species interactions using Vivarium 2.0 in a .ipynb format. 
3.   [In silico scripts](https://github.com/vivarium-collective/Rebekahs_Rotation_Project/tree/main/in_silico_scripts)
Utilization of [In silico functions]([url](https://github.com/vivarium-collective/Rebekahs_Rotation_Project/tree/main/in_silico_functions)) and scripted cdFBA simulation work in .py file format.
